# Architecture - aws-cost-governance-kit

This repository provides tooling focused on the DevOps/SRE domain. High-level design:

- Inputs: declarative config with safe defaults
- Engine: idempotent operations and dry-run plans
- Integrations: AWS/Kubernetes/CI as applicable
- Observability: structured logs and clear outcomes

Future enhancements:
- More pluggable providers
- Better drift detection
- Richer CLI UX and docs
